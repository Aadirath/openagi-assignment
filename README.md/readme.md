FastAPI Workflow Management API
This document provides an overview of your FastAPI application for managing user workflows.

Project Description:

This project implements a basic workflow management API using FastAPI. It allows users to [list functionalities you've implemented, e.g., create and retrieve] workflows.

Tech Stack:

Python 3.x
FastAPI [Add version number if specific version was required]
Pydantic (optional: for data validation - mention if used) [Add version number if specific version was required]
File Structure:

main.py: Entry point for the application, starting the FastAPI server and mounting the router.
workflow.py: Contains the API endpoints for managing workflows (currently [list implemented functions, e.g., create_workflow, get_workflow]).
API Endpoints:

[HTTP Method] /workflows (Replace with actual method, e.g., POST): [Describe the purpose of the endpoint, e.g., Creates a new workflow based on the received data in the request body.] (Optional: Mention data validation using Pydantic if implemented)
GET /workflows/{workflow_id}: Retrieves a specific workflow by its ID.
Running the Application:

Ensure you have Python 3.x and pip installed.
Create a virtual environment (recommended) and activate it.
Install project dependencies (replace with actual command if different): pip install fastapi pydantic[full] (include pydantic[full] only if using data validation).
Run the application from the terminal: [Your command to run the application, e.g., python main.py]
Testing the API:

You can use tools like Postman or curl to send requests to your API endpoints:

Example for creating a workflow (replace with actual data structure if different):

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/workflows -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "My Workflow"}'
GET /workflows/{workflow_id}: Retrieves a specific workflow by its ID (replace 1 with the actual ID).

Future Enhancements:

Implement data validation using Pydantic models for stricter data control (if not already implemented).
Replace the in-memory storage with a persistent storage mechanism (e.g., database).
Add API endpoints for updating, deleting, and listing workflows (if not already implemented).
Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms (if not already implemented).
Error handling for various scenarios (e.g., missing data, invalid requests).
Unit tests for API endpoints.
